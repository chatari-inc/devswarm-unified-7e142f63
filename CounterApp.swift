The existing CounterApp.swift implementation is already well-designed and meets all the specification requirements:

âœ… **Requirements Met:**
- Displays current count value prominently (large 80pt font)
- Provides increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons
- Uses clean, modern SwiftUI design patterns
- Implements proper state management with @State
- Includes accessibility labels for VoiceOver support
- Color-coded buttons (green for +, red for -)
- Circular button design with shadows
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- Additional reset functionality beyond requirements

The implementation exceeds the specification by including:
- A reset button with conditional opacity
- Smooth animations with `withAnimation`
- Drop shadows for visual depth
- Proper spacing and layout
- System background color support

The code follows SwiftUI best practices and provides excellent accessibility support. No changes are needed as the implementation already fully satisfies all requirements.
